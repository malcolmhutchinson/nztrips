nztrips - excursion planner
---------------------------

A GeoDjango project to plan and record trips. Road trips, tramping or
cycling trips.

Plan routes and points of interest for a trip, then download these as
GPX files for use in the field. Upload GPX files collected during the
trip. Display these data on a map, edit and share them.

The application will hook into spatial data about New Zealand held at
Land Information NZ (LINZ), listing roads, rivers, place names and
other data.
